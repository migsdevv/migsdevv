# Hi, I'm Miguel! ðŸ‘‹

You can call me migs ^^ I'm a 16 year old ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ SHS student studying TVL-ICT at De La Salle University â€“ DasmariÃ±as ðŸ’š

I primarily do full-stack web development as a hobby, and recently in a more professional capacity through freelance work.

Here on my Github, you will see repositories of many of my projects here. Whether it be a serious side-project of mine, or just a way for me to goof around, you'll for sure see it here.
